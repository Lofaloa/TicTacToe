# Tic Tac Toe
Simple implementation of [*tic tac toe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

I developed this game during the first year of of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have done it during my free time. I did it with the objective to teach myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Later I tried implementing the min max algorithm so that the user could play against a perfect AI.

## Features
- **Theme:** it is possible to switch between day and night mode.
- **Bot opponent:** currently the AI opponent play randomly but I am working on an unbeatable implementation. I am doing so by implementing the minmax algorithm.
- **Scores:** the game keeps track of the score of players. When the game is restarted the scores are resetted.
