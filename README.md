# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple implementation of [*tic tac toe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). I am coding this for fun during my free time. 

## Features
### Theme
It is possible to switch between day and night mode.

### AI opponent
Currently the AI opponent play randomly but I am working on an unbeatable implementation. I am doing so by implementing the minmax algorithm.

### Scores
The game keeps track of the score of players. When the game is restarted the scores are resetted.
